                                        with a golden sheen of sunrise lurking far on the horizon. Some people are
                                        walking their dogs, while others are still enjoying a nice warm cuddle of a
                                        thick blanket in Melbourne's early spring.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        It will be a beautiful and peaceful Saturday, some might say. My friends and I
                                        will probably find a dinner spot in the CBD tonight, and enjoy the vibrant
                                        weekend night life that makes Melbourne what it is.

                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I know, the timing to write about this subject is so odd. I understand that.

                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        But I'm a weirdo anyway. And my emotion has decided that this is the best time
                                        to write, to express. To finally show the world my inner thoughts, although I've
                                        tried desperately hard to hide them.

                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Okay, enough of me rambling, let us have a conversation about anxiety, and the
                                        verge of depression. Just know that this is me confessing, and opening my world.
                                        <br><br>
                                        To you.

                                    <h2>On Anxiety</h2>
                                    <p style="color: rgb(62, 62, 62);">I feel like everyone has felt anxiety at least
                                        once in their life.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        You present your work in front of an audience. <br>
                                        You are minutes away from a job interview. <br>
                                        You are not under the financial circumstances that you desire. <br>
                                        You realise how uncertain the future truly is.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The feeling when you sunk in the ocean of negative thoughts, and self-imagined
                                        outcomes. Then, you get lost in your own thoughts. You can even feel a blockage
                                        in your lungs that makes it harder to breathe.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>

                                        That, is anxiety.

                                        <br>
                                        <br>

                                        My version of anxiety comes from many directions. It's going to be a lot, so I
                                        suggest you skip the below paragraph to the summary after it.

                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The concern for my family, as I'm far away from them, and seeing time ticking,
                                        counting out their existence in this world. The desire to love, and to be loved.
                                        The overworked hustle that I strive to pursue, in order to achieve a certain
                                        financial security. The amount of cash and assets that I've burned in order to
                                        pursue my entrepreneurship dream. The highs and lows I've been through in that
                                        process. The desperate attempt to be understanding, to be compassionate with
                                        every single human being, losing your own sense of self in the process. The fact
                                        that I can't stop thinking about the past, what could have been acted
                                        differently; and I can't stop spending most of my time living in my own head,
                                        trapped in a cycle of "what-ifs" and missed opportunities. The struggle to find
                                        balance between ambition and contentment, between chasing dreams and
                                        appreciating the present. The fear of regret - both for actions taken and
                                        opportunities missed - that overshadows every decision. The longing for a sense
                                        of purpose and direction, amidst the chaos of daily life. The ever-changing
                                        landscape of personal and professional challenges, as well as the state of the
                                        very world I'm living in called Earth.

                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Phew, that’s a lot.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>

                                        To summarise it for you: Family. Love. Ambition. Reflection.
                                        <br>

                                        <br>

                                        There are other thoughts as well, but those are the majority that make me sink
                                        deep into my own mind. People say that I'm cold from the outside, almost stoic
                                        in some ways. But trust me, deep inside is a furnace that continuously burns,
                                        and gives, and burns.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>

                                        Some of those thoughts got a chance to evolve, to grow, to spread, like a virus.
                                        And I got a glimpse of the other side of anxiety.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        A side so dark, so unsettling. And having seen people suffering and suffocating
                                        from that side, I'm utterly petrified.

                                        <b>Depression.</b>

                                        <br><br>
                                        Such a strong and extreme word. So extreme that it is classified as a medical
                                        condition. People have suffered from it; some have even died because of it.
                                        <br><br>
                                        I feel like I'm not capable of writing deeply about depression, as I've never
                                        experienced it before, so it would be hypocrisy to do so.
                                        <br><br>
                                        What I can write about though, because it's true, is my glimpse.
                                        <br><br>
                                        I had a glimpse into it. On the verge of depression:
                                        <br><br>
                                        “I see my other self, the doppelgänger born of fear and doubt. This version of
                                        me was unable to weather the storm of anxiety that battered his psyche. He
                                        stands as a ghost of what could have been had I taken a different path.
                                        <br><br>
                                        He got lost in the labyrinth of thoughts, each turn leading deeper into the maze
                                        of his own making. Eventually, he lost his sense of self, and taken over is a
                                        spiral of thoughts.
                                        <br><br>
                                        His thoughts continued past the edge of his consciousness. They penetrated
                                        further deeply, reaching his heart, his innermost feelings. Whispers turned into
                                        yells, drowning out the voice of hope and reason. Now firmly established, these
                                        ideas started to coil around themselves with his entire being, becoming woven
                                        into the very fabric of his spirit.
                                        <br><br>
                                        He eventually lost his identity, much like a statue worn down by constant waves.
                                        The lines separating existence and thought first became hazy and eventually
                                        vanished completely. The person he was before - one with aspirations, dreams,
                                        and a distinct viewpoint on the world - vanished and was replaced by a
                                        depressing echo chamber.
                                        <br><br>
                                        All that was left was a spiral of thoughts rather than a person. These weren't
                                        just ordinary thoughts; rather, they were a tornado of uncertainty, anxiety, and
                                        pessimism. They continuously whirled, strengthening themselves with each turn as
                                        they fed off one another. This downward spiral became his new normal, a
                                        self-made jail consisting of walls made of fears, regrets, and what-if
                                        scenarios.”

                                        <br><br>
                                        I sensed the human mind's vulnerability in this glance, as well as the thin line
                                        separating willpower and surrender. It was a reminder of the influence our
                                        thoughts can have over us and their ability to either elevate or depress us.

                                        <br><br>
                                        Fortunately, I managed not to stepped into that world. Multiple times. And I’m
                                        eternally grateful for that.
                                        <br><br>
                                        You may ask: “How?”. And I will tell you now, how did I turn my back.
                                        <br><br>
                                        And walk away from the verge of depression.

                                        For those who live mostly inside their heads like me, finding a medium to
                                        express your thoughts is a great way to relax. Mine is poetry, journaling, and
                                        occasional writings like this one.

                                        I think that's all. Basically, this is me constantly distracting myself from the
                                        thoughts to feel, to touch, and to see all the world has to offer.

                                        The sky is still bright and blue. The sun has risen further into the day. Some
                                        birds are chirping outside my window. People are walking on the sidewalk, each
                                        having their own stories and emotions.
                                        <br><br>
                                        What a beautiful and peaceful Saturday, I will say.

                                        Anxiety will always be there; it's the mind's natural response to issues. The
                                        verge of depression will always be there in your sight.
                                        <br><br><br>
                                        So, whenever you find yourself standing on that verge, just close your eyes...
                                        <br><br>
                                        Take a deep breath.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Turn your back.
                                        <br><br>
                                        And walk away.
